## QuickDto

##### A Java Library to Generate DTOs from Entities
On its own this does not do much, but the jar generated by the core
of the application can be copied over for use in any project.

Using the @GeneratesDto annotation on the top of an entity source file
will cause a Dto for that file to be produced at compile time using
annotation processing.

Currently only output Dto path can be customized (by passing it into the annotation).
This may be expanded in future in order to provide for edge case business requirements in some Dtos.

How to add to project:

As there is no online maven repo for this project, you will need to build this locally
and copy the jar over to your own project.

Create a local maven repository in your project location and reference it as a dependency
